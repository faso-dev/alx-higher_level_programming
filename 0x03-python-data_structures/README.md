Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

In this project, you will learn about lists and tuples in Python.

Lists in python are very similar to arrays in C. They are a collection of elements that can be of any type. Lists are mutable, meaning that you can change the elements of a list after it has been created. Tuples are immutable, meaning that you cannot change the elements of a tuple after it has been created. 
Tuples are very similar to lists except for the fact that tuples are immutable. Tuples are usually faster than lists as they cannot change dynamically.
